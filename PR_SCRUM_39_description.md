## üõ† Technical Implementation

### Architecture Components
- **MultiCarrierQuotationService**: Core business logic service
- **QuotationRequest/Response Models**: Standardized data structures
- **Recommendation Engine**: Weighted scoring algorithm
- **Carrier Factory Integration**: Seamless integration with existing carrier services

### Key Files Added/Modified
- `src/quotation/multi_carrier.py` - Core multi-carrier quotation service
- `src/quotation/__init__.py` - Module initialization
- `tests/test_multi_carrier_quotations.py` - Comprehensive test suite
- `src/main.py` - API endpoints and service integration

### Data Models
```python
# Quotation Request
class QuotationRequest:
    origin_country: str
    destination_country: str
    weight_kg: float
    dimensions_cm: Dict[str, float]
    value: float
    carrier_codes: Optional[List[str]]
    service_types: Optional[List[str]]

# Carrier Quote Response
class CarrierQuote:
    carrier_code: str
    service_type: str
    total_cost: float
    transit_days: int
    confidence_score: float
    cost_breakdown: Dict[str, float]
```

### Recommendation Algorithm
```python
# Weighted scoring system (0-1 scale, lower is better)
total_score = (cost_score * 0.5) + (speed_score * 0.3) + (reliability_score * 0.2)

# Factors considered:
- Cost competitiveness (50% weight)
- Delivery speed (30% weight)  
- Carrier reliability (20% weight)
```

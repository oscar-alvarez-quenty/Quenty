  "description": "New customer account created",
  "event": "Customer created successfully with ID: 12345",

}
```

### Message Code Format
- **Prefix**: Service identifier (CUST_, ORD_, etc.)
- **Type**: E=Error, W=Warning, I=Info, D=Debug
- **Number**: Sequential number (001, 002, etc.)
- **Example**: `CUST_E001`, `ORD_I005`, `AUTH_W003`

## üéõÔ∏è Dashboard Customization

### Adding New Filters
Edit `/docker/grafana/provisioning/dashboards/quenty-microservices-logs.json`:
1. Add new template variable in `templating.list`
2. Update panel queries to use the new variable
3. Restart Grafana container

### Modifying Queries
- Panel queries use LogQL (Loki Query Language)
- Template variables: `$variable_name`
- Regex filters: `logger=~".*($service).*"`
- Text search: `|~ "search_term"`

## üîÑ Testing the Dashboard

Run the test script to generate sample logs:
```bash
python3 test-logging.py
```

This will:
- Hit health endpoints across all services
- Generate authentication errors (403s)
- Create various log entries for testing filters

## üìû Support

For issues with the dashboard:
1. Check Loki is receiving logs: http://localhost:3100/ready
2. Verify Grafana data source: Settings ‚Üí Data Sources ‚Üí Loki
3. Check service logs: `docker logs quenty-<service-name>`
4. Restart Grafana: `docker restart quenty-grafana`

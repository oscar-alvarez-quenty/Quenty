# SCRUM-13: DHL, FedEx, and UPS Carrier Integrations

## 📋 Summary
This PR implements comprehensive carrier integrations for DHL Express, FedEx, and UPS to enable multi-carrier shipping capabilities in the international shipping service.

## ✨ Features Implemented

### 🚚 Carrier Integrations
- **DHL Express Integration**: Complete API integration with rate calculation, shipment creation, tracking, and cancellation
- **FedEx Integration**: OAuth-based API integration with service type normalization and comprehensive error handling
- **UPS Integration**: Full API integration with address validation and enhanced tracking capabilities

### 🏭 Factory Pattern Implementation
- **CarrierFactory**: Centralized factory for creating carrier integration instances
- **Configuration Templates**: Pre-defined configuration templates for each carrier
- **Sandbox Support**: Full sandbox mode support for testing without real API calls

### 🔌 API Endpoints Added
- `POST /api/v1/carriers/{carrier_code}/configure` - Configure carrier credentials
- `GET /api/v1/carriers/templates` - Get configuration templates
- `POST /api/v1/shipping/rates/calculate` - Calculate rates from multiple carriers
- `POST /api/v1/shipping/shipments` - Create shipments with selected carrier
- `GET /api/v1/shipping/track/{tracking_number}` - Track shipments
- `POST /api/v1/shipping/shipments/{tracking_number}/cancel` - Cancel shipments
- `POST /api/v1/shipping/validate-address` - Validate shipping addresses

## 🛠 Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Abstract Base Class**: `CarrierIntegrationBase` defines standardized interfaces
- **Concrete Implementations**: Separate classes for DHL, FedEx, and UPS
- **Async Support**: All integrations are fully asynchronous
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with proper HTTP status codes

### Key Files Added/Modified
- `src/integrations/base.py` - Abstract base class and data models
- `src/integrations/dhl.py` - DHL Express integration
- `src/integrations/fedex.py` - FedEx integration with OAuth
- `src/integrations/ups.py` - UPS integration
- `src/integrations/factory.py` - Factory pattern implementation
- `src/main.py` - API endpoints and integration points

### Configuration Support
```python
# DHL Configuration
{
    "api_key": "your_dhl_api_key",
    "api_secret": "your_dhl_secret"
}

# FedEx Configuration  
{
    "api_key": "your_fedex_key",
    "api_secret": "your_fedex_secret",
    "account_number": "your_account_number"
}

# UPS Configuration
{
    "api_key": "your_ups_key", 
    "user_id": "your_ups_user",
    "password": "your_ups_password",
    "account_number": "your_account_number"
}
```

## 🧪 Testing
- ✅ **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive test coverage for all carrier integrations
- ✅ **Integration Tests**: End-to-end testing with mock APIs
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Testing of various error scenarios
- ✅ **Sandbox Mode**: All carriers tested in sandbox environments

## 🔧 Bug Fixes
- **Fixed syntax error in UPS integration (line 419)** - corrected unterminated string literal
- Enhanced error handling for network timeouts and API failures
- Improved response formatting and data validation

## 📊 Performance
- **Concurrent Operations**: All carrier operations support concurrent execution
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient HTTP client management
- **Caching**: Rate and configuration caching where appropriate
- **Timeout Handling**: Proper timeout management for all API calls

## ⚡ Next Steps
- [ ] Production API credentials configuration
- [ ] Enhanced logging and monitoring
- [ ] Rate limiting implementation
- [ ] Webhook support for real-time tracking updates

## 🔍 Testing Instructions
1. **Start the service**: `docker-compose up --build`
2. **Configure carriers**: Use the configuration endpoints to set up carrier credentials
3. **Calculate rates**: Test multi-carrier rate calculation
4. **Create shipments**: Test shipment creation with different carriers
5. **Track shipments**: Test tracking functionality
6. **Validate addresses**: Test address validation

## 📈 Impact
- Enables multi-carrier shipping capabilities
- Provides customers with rate comparison and carrier choice
- Reduces dependency on single carrier
- Improves shipping reliability and options

## 🔒 Security Considerations
- API credentials are handled securely with proper encryption
- Sandbox mode prevents accidental production API calls
- Input validation on all carrier API interactions
- Proper error handling to prevent information leakage

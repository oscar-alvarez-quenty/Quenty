# Metrics Endpoints Verification Report

## Test Results - All Services ✅ PASSING

All microservices now have working `/metrics` endpoints that return Prometheus-compatible metrics.

### Service Status Summary

| Service | Port | Status | Custom Metrics |
|---------|------|--------|---------------|
| Auth Service | 8009 | ✅ HTTP 200 | `auth_requests_total`, `auth_active_sessions_total`, `auth_failed_login_attempts_total` |
| Customer Service | 8001 | ✅ HTTP 200 | `customer_operations_total`, `customer_support_tickets_total` |
| Order Service | 8002 | ✅ HTTP 200 | `order_operations_total` |
| Analytics Service | 8006 | ✅ HTTP 200 | `analytics_operations_total` |
| Franchise Service | 8008 | ✅ HTTP 200 | `franchise_operations_total` |
| International Shipping | 8004 | ✅ HTTP 200 | `intl_shipping_operations_total` |
| Microcredit Service | 8005 | ✅ HTTP 200 | `microcredit_operations_total` |
| Pickup Service | 8003 | ✅ HTTP 200 | `pickup_service_operations_total` |
| Reverse Logistics | 8007 | ✅ HTTP 200 | `reverse_logistics_operations_total` |
| API Gateway | 8000 | ✅ HTTP 200 | `api_gateway_operations_total` |

### Test Commands Used

```bash
# Test individual service
curl -s -w "HTTP Status: %{http_code}\n" -o /dev/null http://localhost:PORT/metrics

# View metrics content
curl -s http://localhost:PORT/metrics | grep -E "(service_name_|http_requests_total)"
```

### Issues Resolved

1. **Pickup Service Import Conflict**: Fixed naming conflict between `datetime.time` and `time` module by using `time as dt_time` import.
2. **Missing Endpoints**: Added `/metrics` endpoints to analytics, franchise, reverse-logistics, and api-gateway services.
3. **Prometheus Client**: Verified all services have prometheus-client==0.19.0 in requirements.txt.

### Metrics Available

Each service exposes:
- **Standard Python metrics**: GC, memory, process stats
- **HTTP metrics**: Request counts, durations, status codes  
- **Service-specific metrics**: Business operations, domain-specific counters
- **Common format**: All metrics follow Prometheus naming conventions

### Prometheus Integration

Services are configured to be scraped by Prometheus in the docker-compose configuration. Metrics are available for:
- Alerting and monitoring
- Grafana dashboard visualization
- Performance analysis
- Business metrics tracking

### Test Date
**Verification completed**: $(date)
**Docker Environment**: All services running via docker-compose.microservices.yml
**Network**: Services accessible on localhost with mapped ports

## Next Steps

1. Verify Prometheus is scraping all targets: http://localhost:9090/targets
2. Check Grafana dashboards: http://localhost:3000
3. Set up alerting rules for critical metrics
4. Add custom business metrics as needed
